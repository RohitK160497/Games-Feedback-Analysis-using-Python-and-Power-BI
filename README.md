# 🎲 Game Feedback Data Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project presents a detailed analysis of feedback collected from university students who participated in a board game designed to teach the acquisition process. The study evaluates educational impact, user engagement, clarity of rules, and overall experience using both quantitative and qualitative methods.

## 🧪 Objectives

- Assess the effectiveness of the game in raising awareness of the acquisition process
- Identify common issues or points of confusion
- Analyze sentiment and patterns in participant feedback
- Provide actionable insights for game improvement


## 📊 Tools & Technologies

  - `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `textblob`, `wordcloud`
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboard for university-wise insights
- **Excel:** Initial data exploration and preprocessing

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Awareness:** >60% students agreed the game raised their awareness about acquisitions.
- **Rules Confusion:** 79% of respondents found the game rules at least somewhat confusing.
- **Sentiment Trends:**
  - **University A**: Mostly neutral to positive feedback.
  - **Universities B & D**: Higher ratio of negative sentiment.
- **Top Complaints:**
  - Lack of clarity in instructions
  - Redundant gameplay and imbalance in card effects
  - Limited competitiveness and unclear objectives

## 📈 Visuals & Reporting

- Power BI dashboard includes:
  - University-wise sentiment comparison
  - Agreement distribution per question
  - Feedback volume breakdown
- Word clouds and bar plots generated via Python for qualitative themes

## ✅ Conclusion

The game successfully promoted awareness of the acquisition process but fell short in user experience due to confusing rules, lack of competition, and clarity issues. Participant feedback highlights key areas for enhancement, paving the way for a more effective and engaging educational tool.
